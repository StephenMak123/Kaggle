    "The Titanic's maiden voyage was on April 15th, 1912, which killed 1502 out of 2224 (67.5%) of the onboard passengers. The intent of this competition is to determine which passengers were likely to survive using various machine learning tools.\n",

    "The exam question is to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. \n",

    "\n",
    "\"pclass\", or Ticket Class, a categorical variable where 1 = 1st Class, 2 = 2nd Class, 3 = 3rd Class.\n",
    "This could be an important feature as the number of lifeboats available to each ticket class may have varied.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Sex\" (could) be a binary variable, assuming one denotes male, and another female.\n",
    "This could be an important feature as it is believed that females and children were advised to leave the boat first.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Age\" is the passenger's age in years. Note that if the age has been estimated, it will finish in \"xx.5\". Therefore, there is potential for feature engineering to create an \"estimated age yes/no\" feature. Note also if the age is less than 1 it is fractional.\n",
